  <h1>Matthew McConaghey is Cool</h1>
  <p>Many people today think Matthew McConaghey is a chauch. There are those who claim he is a terrible actor.<p>


<p>Why would something think he is a chauch. Let's review</p>


<p>It might be because of reasons such as Sahara, the Scorpion King, and his string of sappy romcoms such as Ghost of Girlfriends Past</p>

<p>Some would even go beyond his film career and stem their grief for his wild behavior. Check out this police report from 1999:</p>

<p>Police went to the actor's house around 3 a.m. after a neighbor complained of loud music. According to the police report, an officer looked in a window, saw the actor dancing around naked and playing bongo drums, while another man clapped. The cop went to the door, smelled pot and decided to search the place. He found a bowl filled with marijuana stems and seeds, a bong and a pipe. The police report says both men "were very intoxicated," with "glassy and very bloodshot eyes."</p>

<p>So is Matthew McConaghey just washed-up and overhyped who should have never attained stardom?</p>

<h1>In defense of Matthew McConaghey</h1>

<p>Matthew McConcaghey's a versatile actor. He's not the prototypical romcom lead that he's notoriously known for.</p>

<p>Let's first talk about his role in cult classic "Dazed and Confused."</p>

<p>That was a pretty big deal. Many people stop here and think he's a 1 hit wonder. But there's more.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about his more recent performances. Because MMC has reinvented himself in recent years proving he is worth his salt.</p>



<p>such as Dallas Buyer's Club</p>

<p>And Interstellar</p>

<p>Most recently he's been a star performer in HBO serie's true detective</p>

<h1>In conclusion</h1>

<p>He's a good actor and he has an air to him that's sort of dumb. Like, just look at his Lincoln Commericials.</p>

<p>It can be hard to take him serious.</p>

<p>But I argue that McConaghey knows what he's doing. See he's not ACTUALLY taking himself seriously, but he walks the line of it being so serious. So maybe people think he's really being serious?</p>

<p>McConaghey basically just knows how to chill and not take life so seriously. He's a good guy and works hard. But most people don't want to see this. They either are bitter or they don't have a good sense of humor. Just my 2 cents.</p>
